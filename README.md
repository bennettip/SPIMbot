# SPIMbot

Tasks:
  -build interrupt structure(B)
    -handle fires
    -handle bonk
    -
    
  -build KenKen solver structure
  
  -design plant harvesting algorithm
  
  -design seed planting algorithm
  
  -design watering algorithm
  
  -build generalized move function with trig (to a given location)
  
  
  priorities
    -if fire, put out fire
     -if there is a puzzle, solve puzzle
     -if there is a fully grown crop, harvest
     (what's MAX_GROWTH? Is harvesting a interrupt-triggered event)
